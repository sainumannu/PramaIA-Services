## 🎯 **Key Problem Solved: Legacy Node Compatibility**

### The Challenge

**Root Issue**: The system had evolved from PDF-specific to document-generic architecture, but:
- Database contained **54 legacy node types** (e.g., `PDFInput`, `UpdateInputValidator`)
- PDK Server had **modern node IDs** (e.g., `document_input_node`, `text_filter`)
- WorkflowEngine couldn't find processors for legacy node types
- Pipeline failed at workflow execution despite successful event/trigger matching

### Evolution Timeline

```
Legacy System (PDF-focused):
  PDFInput → PDFTextExtractor → ChromaVectorStore
  
  ↓ Architecture Evolution ↓
  
Modern System (Document-generic):
  document_input_node → pdf_text_extractor → chroma_vector_store
```

### Solution: Direct PDK API Architecture

**Implemented**: Complete architectural simplification with direct API communication

1. **Direct API Communication**: Eliminated registry complexity for streamlined PDK interaction
   - Real-time plugin discovery via HTTP API
   - No database overhead for node management
   - Direct server-to-server communication

2. **Simplified Architecture**: Direct PDK integration without registry layers
   ```python
   # Direct PDK API calls
   response = requests.get('http://localhost:3001/plugins')
   available_nodes = response.json()
   
   # Execute workflows directly
   result = requests.post(f'http://localhost:3001/execute/{node_type}', 
                         json=workflow_data)
   ```

3. **Runtime Discovery**: Real-time plugin ecosystem access
   ```
   WorkflowEngine → Direct PDK API → PDK Server
   ```

## 🔍 Next Steps: Debugging Trigger Matching

### Investigation Priorities

1. **Check Trigger Configuration**
   - Verify `event_type="file_upload"` and `source="web-client-upload"`
   - Ensure triggers are `active=1`
   - Review trigger conditions

2. **Verify Event Data Format**
   - Check event payload matches trigger expectations
   - Validate event data structure
   - Test manual trigger activation

3. **Database Table Alignment**
   - Confirm CRUD queries correct table
   - Verify trigger data consistency
   - Check for schema mismatches

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check active triggers
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('PramaIAServer/backend/db/database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT name, event_type, source, active FROM workflow_triggers WHERE active=1')
for row in cursor.fetchall(): print(f'{row[0]}: {row[1]} from {row[2]}')
conn.close()
"

# Check recent events  
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('PramaIAServer/backend/db/database.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('SELECT event_type, source, triggers_matched FROM event_logs ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 3')
for row in cursor.fetchall(): print(f'{row[0]} from {row[1]}, matches: {row[2]}')
conn.close()
"
```
